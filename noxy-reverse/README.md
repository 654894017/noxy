- implement healthchecks so that we can mark boxes offline...
     
- support randomizing requests across the servers
       
- how do we change the host config as hosts change?  maybe use an 
  AtomicReference and swap in a new object?   

- what do we do about HTTP keep alive?
 
- what about TCP timeouts?

- test what happens when we don't have any backend servers
